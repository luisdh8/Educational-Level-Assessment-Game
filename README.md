# Educational Level Assessment Program

## Project Description

The Educational Level Assessment Program is designed to evaluate the educational levels of students, ranging from third-grade of elementary school to third-year middle school, in the subjects of mathematics and Spanish. Users can create accounts with passwords to log in and access the program.

The core functionality of the program is based on a scoring system that tracks the user's progress, assigning scores for each correct or incorrect answer. The initial score is calculated based on the user's educational level, multiplied by 200.

- The program features dynamic scoring that determines the questions presented to the user.
- Correct answers add 10 points to the user's score, while incorrect answers deduct 5 points.
- Users who lose points below their educational level are moved to a lower section with corresponding questions, and those who excel beyond their level are presented with questions from a higher level.
- To keep the learning experience engaging, questions are randomized, ensuring that no question is repeated until all questions within a level have been covered.

This program promotes a culture of responsible electricity usage, aims to reduce environmental impact, enhance safety and health, and save electricity costs for households.
